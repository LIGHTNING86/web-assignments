    <div class="p1" style="position: absolute; top: 45%;">
        Hello and welcome to my website. I am Spandan Marathe, a student of Diploma in Computer Technology at K. K. Wagh Polytechnic, Nashik. I loved Computers since childhood and as I grew up, I found myself opening and re-buliting PC's and different electronic components. Due to this, I read a lot of books on Early Generation of Computers, books from famous IT Entrepreneur like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, David Packard. This led to my increase in hobby of reading books. I started reading different novels, fictions, mystery stories, classics and action and adventure books. I have my little personal book collection which consists of Novels, Business Management, Mystery Stories, Comics, Geography and Space Studies and some books on Effective Education. My goal is to be an Exceptional IT Professional and do the work that I love the most. I am interested in Web Developement and I find it very amusing that you can built every small detail of the website you are working on as per your taste. There are millions and millions of different combinations you can try and millions of different color shades and contrasts that you can use to make your Web Site appealing. And it is an evergrowing field where everyday, new updates, new styles, new methods are born. This is the most interesting thing about working as a Web Developer.

        <p>My dream is to have a large personal collection of books. Reading is the best way to pass your time when you are alone or even when you are travelling. You get good knowledge about people, places and other activities from the books. While reading books and stories, one is often transported to a different world, the world of the author. One can also develop his own visual images of the situation while reading the book. Helps you in understanding people and situation and you tend to deal with the same more intelligently. The biographies and the autobiographies or even the simple reading materials often tell us about people and places.</p>
        <p>I also love to write different programs in different languages. I have learnt different programming languages like C, C++, Java, Advanced Java, VB.Net, ASP.Net and HTML. Coding is an interesting and fun way to spend time as you don't know whether the output and result will be as you have expected, but the thrill of the output will always get you. This leads me to write and code more programs and I enjoy my time working on different programs. Programming is a rewarding career as well as an engaging hobby for developers. If you keep the approach to programming as a hobby than a job, you will sharpen your skills in a practical way. It can also be a fantastic way to master any new programming language.</p>
